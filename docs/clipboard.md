# Clipboard

Verify makes use of the clipboard.

This is done via the [TextCopy project](https://github.com/CopyText/TextCopy).


## Accept received

When a verification fails, a command to accept the received version is added to the clipboard:

On Windows:

> cmd /c move /Y "ReceivedFile" "VerifiedFile"

On Linux or OS:

> mv -f "ReceivedFile" "VerifiedFile"


## Cleanup dangling converter files

When a the number of files outputted from a [converter](converter.mc) reduces, a command to delete the extra files is added to the clipboard:

On Windows:

> cmd /c del "VerifiedFile"

On Linux or OS:

> rm -f "VerifiedFile"


## Custom Command

A custom command can be used by adding environment variables.


### Accept

Add a variable named `Verify.MoveCommand` where `{0}` and `{1}` will be replaced with the received and verified files respectively.


### Cleanup

Add a variable named `Verify.DeleteCommand` where `{0}` will be replaced with the file to be cleaned up.


## Disable Clipboard

The clipboard behavior can be disable using the following:


### Per Test

<!-- snippet: DisableClipboard -->
<a id='snippet-disableclipboard'/></a>
```cs
var settings = new VerifySettings();
settings.DisableClipboard();
```
<sup><a href='/src/Verify.Tests/Snippets/Snippets.cs#L36-L41' title='File snippet `disableclipboard` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-disableclipboard' title='Navigate to start of snippet `disableclipboard`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->


### For all tests

<!-- snippet: DisableClipboardGlobal -->
<a id='snippet-disableclipboardglobal'/></a>
```cs
VerifierSettings.DisableClipboard();
```
<sup><a href='/src/Verify.Tests/Snippets/Snippets.cs#L56-L60' title='File snippet `disableclipboardglobal` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-disableclipboardglobal' title='Navigate to start of snippet `disableclipboardglobal`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

If clipboard is disabled for all tests, it can be re-enabled at the test level:

<!-- snippet: EnableClipboard -->
<a id='snippet-enableclipboard'/></a>
```cs
var settings = new VerifySettings();
settings.EnableClipboard();
```
<sup><a href='/src/Verify.Tests/Snippets/Snippets.cs#L46-L51' title='File snippet `enableclipboard` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-enableclipboard' title='Navigate to start of snippet `enableclipboard`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->


### For a machine

Set a `Verify.DisableClipboard` environment variable to `true`. This overrides the above settings.
