# Comparer

Comparers are use to non-text files.


## Custom Comparer

Using a custom comparer can be helpful when a result has changed, but not enough to fail verification. For examples when rendering images/forms on different operating systems.

For samples purposes case insensitive string comparison will be used:

snippet: IgnoreCaseCompare

snippet: InstanceComparer


### Static comparer

snippet: StaticComparer


## Default Comparison
