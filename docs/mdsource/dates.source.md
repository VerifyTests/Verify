# Dates


By default dates and times (`DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `DateOnly`, and `TimeOnly`) are sanitized during verification. This is done by finding each date and taking a counter based that that specific date. That counter is then used replace the date values. This allows for repeatable tests when date values are changing.

## DisableDateCounting

If many calls are made to the current date/time in quick succession, the date counting behavior (`DateTime_x`) can result in inconsistent results. To revert to the simpler scrubbing convention (`{Scrubbed}`) use DisableDateCounting.
