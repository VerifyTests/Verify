## Add NuGet packages

Add the following packages to the test project:


snippet: MSTest-nugets


## Implicit Usings

include: implicit-usings


## Source Control

### Includes/Excludes

include: include-exclude

### Text file settings

include: text-file-settings


## DiffEngineTray

Install [DiffEngineTray](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/tray.md)

DiffEngineTray sits in the Windows tray. It monitors pending changes in snapshots, and provides a mechanism for accepting or rejecting those changes.

```
dotnet tool install -g DiffEngineTray
```

This is optional, but recommended. Also consider enabling [Run at startup](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/tray.md#run-at-startup).


## ReSharper


### Orphaned process detection

[Disable orphaned process detection](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#disable-orphaned-process-detection).


## Verify Plugin

Install the [ReSharper Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17241-verify-support)

Provides a mechanism for contextually accepting or rejecting snapshot changes inside the ReSharper test runner.

This is optional, but recommended.

## DiffPlex

The text comparison behavior of Verify is pluggable. The default behaviour, on failure, is to output both the received
and the verified contents as part of the exception. This can be noisy when verifying large strings.

[Verify.DiffPlex](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.DiffPlex) changes the text compare result to highlighting text differences inline.

This is optional, but recommended.

### Add the NuGet

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Verify.DiffPlex" Version="*" />
```

### Enable

```cs
[ModuleInitializer]
public static void Initialize() =>
    VerifyDiffPlex.Initialize();
```


## Sample Test

## Diff Tool

Verify supports many [Diff Tools](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#supported-tools) for comparing received to verified.
While IDEs are supported, due to their MDI nature, using a different Diff Tool is recommended.
