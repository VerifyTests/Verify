# Getting .received files from CI


## AppVeyor

Use an [on_failure build step](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/#build-pipeline) to call [Push-AppveyorArtifact](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-worker-api/#push-artifact).

<!-- snippet: AppVeyorArtifacts -->
<a id='snippet-appveyorartifacts'/></a>
```yml
on_failure:
- ps: >-
    $receivedFiles = Get-ChildItem .\**\*.received.*

    foreach ($receivedFile in $receivedFiles)
    {
      Push-AppveyorArtifact $receivedFile.FullName -FileName $receivedFile.Name
    }
```
