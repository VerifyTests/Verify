# Getting .received files from CI


## AppVeyor

Use an [on_failure build step](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/#build-pipeline) to call [Push-AppveyorArtifact](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-worker-api/#push-artifact).

<!-- snippet: AppVeyorArtifacts -->
<a id='snippet-appveyorartifacts'/></a>
```yml
on_failure:
  - ps: Get-ChildItem *.received.* -recurse | % { Push-AppveyorArtifact $_.FullName -FileName $_.Name }
```
<sup><a href='/src/appveyor.yml#L11-L14' title='File snippet `appveyorartifacts` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-appveyorartifacts' title='Navigate to start of snippet `appveyorartifacts`'>anchor</a></sup>
