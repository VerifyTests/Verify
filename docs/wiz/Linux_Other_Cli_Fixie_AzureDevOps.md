# Getting Started Wizard

## Add NuGet packages

Add the following packages to the test project:

```
dotnet add package Fixie
dotnet add package Verify.Fixie
```

## Implicit Usings

**All examples use [Implicit Usings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#implicitusings). Ensure `<ImplicitUsings>` is set to `enable` to ensure examples compile correctly.**<!-- include: implicit-usings. path: /docs/mdsource/implicit-usings.include.md -->

```
<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
```

If `ImplicitUsings` are not enabled, substitute usages of `Verify()` with `Verifier.Verify()`.<!-- endInclude -->


## Conventions


### Source Control Includes/Excludes

 * **All `*.received.*` files should be excluded from source control.**<!-- include: include-exclude. path: /docs/mdsource/include-exclude.include.md -->

eg. add the following to `.gitignore`

```
*.received.*
```

If using [UseSplitModeForUniqueDirectory](/docs/naming.md#usesplitmodeforuniquedirectory) also include:

`*.received/`


All `*.verified.*` files should be committed to source control.<!-- endInclude -->


### Text file settings

Text variants of verified and received have the following characteristics:<!-- include: text-file-settings. path: /docs/mdsource/text-file-settings.include.md -->

 * UTF8 with a [Byte order mark (BOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
 * Newlines as line-feed (lf)
 * No trailing newline

This manifests in several ways:


#### Source control settings

All text extensions of `*.verified.*` should have:

 * `eol` set to `lf`
 * `working-tree-encoding` set to `UTF-8`

eg add the following to `.gitattributes`

```
*.verified.txt text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.verified.xml text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.verified.json text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
```

#### EditorConfig settings

If modifying text verified/received files in an editor, it is desirable for the editor to respect the above conventions. For [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) enabled the following can be used:

```
# Verify settings
[*.{received,verified}.{txt,xml,json}]
charset = "utf-8-bom"
end_of_line = lf
indent_size = unset
indent_style = unset
insert_final_newline = false
tab_width = unset
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```


*Note that the above are suggested for subset of text extension. Add others as required based on the text file types being verified.*<!-- endInclude -->


### Conventions check

Conventions can be checked by calling `VerifyChecks.Run()` in a test

<!-- snippet: VerifyChecksFixie -->
<a id='snippet-VerifyChecksFixie'></a>
```cs
public class VerifyChecksTests
{
    public Task Run() =>
        VerifyChecks.Run(GetType().Assembly);
}
```
<sup><a href='/src/Verify.Fixie.Tests/VerifyChecksTests.cs#L2-L8' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-VerifyChecksFixie' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

## DiffPlex

The text comparison behavior of Verify is pluggable. The default behaviour, on failure, is to output both the received
and the verified contents as part of the exception. This can be noisy when verifying large strings.

[Verify.DiffPlex](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.DiffPlex) changes the text compare result to highlighting text differences inline.

This is optional, but recommended.

### Add the NuGet

```
dotnet add package Verify.DiffPlex
```

### Enable

```cs
[ModuleInitializer]
public static void Initialize() =>
    VerifyDiffPlex.Initialize();
```

## Verify.Terminal

[Verify.Terminal](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.Terminal) is a dotnet tool for managing snapshots from the command line.

This is optional.

### Install the tool

```
dotnet tool install -g verify.tool
```


## Sample Test

<!-- snippet: SampleTestFixie -->
<a id='snippet-SampleTestFixie'></a>
```cs
public class Sample
{
    public Task Test()
    {
        var person = ClassBeingTested.FindPerson();
        return Verify(person);
    }
}
```

Fixie is less opinionated than other test frameworks. As such it leaves up to the consumer how to configure test execution.<!-- include: fixie-convention. path: /docs/mdsource/fixie-convention.include.md -->

To enable Verify  the [ITestProject and IExecution interfaces](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/wiki/Customizing-the-Test-Project-Lifecycle#the-default-convention) need to be used.

Requirements:

 * Assign the target assembly in `ITestProject.Configure` using `VerifierSettings.AssignTargetAssembly`
 * Wrap test executions in `IExecution.Run` using `ExecutionState.Set`

An example implementation of the above:

<!-- snippet: TestProject.cs -->
<a id='snippet-TestProject.cs'></a>
```cs
public class TestProject :
    ITestProject,
    IExecution
{
    public void Configure(TestConfiguration configuration, TestEnvironment environment)
    {
        VerifierSettings.AssignTargetAssembly(environment.Assembly);
        configuration.Conventions.Add<DefaultDiscovery, TestProject>();
    }

    public async Task Run(TestSuite testSuite)
    {
        foreach (var testClass in testSuite.TestClasses)
        {
            foreach (var test in testClass.Tests)
            {
                if (test.HasParameters)
                {
                    foreach (var parameters in test
                                 .GetAll<TestCase>()
                                 .Select(_ => _.Parameters))
                    {
                        using (ExecutionState.Set(testClass, test, parameters))
                        {
                            await test.Run(parameters);
                        }
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    using (ExecutionState.Set(testClass, test, null))
                    {
                        await test.Run();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

## Diff Tool

Verify supports many [Diff Tools](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#supported-tools) for comparing received to verified.
While IDEs are supported, due to their MDI nature, using a different Diff Tool is recommended.

Tools supported by Linux:

 * [BeyondCompare](https://www.scootersoftware.com)
 * [P4Merge](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core-apps/merge-diff-tool-p4merge)
 * [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
 * [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Getting .received in output on Azure DevOps

Directly after the test runner step add a build step to set a flag if the testrunner failed. This is done by using a [failed condition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/conditions?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml). This flag will be evaluated in the CopyFiles and PublishBuildArtifacts steps below.<!-- include: build-server-azuredevops. path: /docs/mdsource/build-server-azuredevops.include.md -->

```yaml
- task: CmdLine@2
  displayName: 'Set flag to publish Verify *.received.* files when test step fails'
  condition: failed()
  inputs:
    script: 'echo ##vso[task.setvariable variable=publishverify]Yes'
```

Since the PublishBuildArtifacts step in DevOps does not allow a wildcard it is necessary to stage the 'received' files before publishing:

```yaml
- task: CopyFiles@2
  condition: eq(variables['publishverify'], 'Yes')
  displayName: 'Copy Verify *.received.* files to Artifact Staging'
  inputs:
    contents: '**\*.received.*' 
    targetFolder: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\Verify'
    cleanTargetFolder: true
    overWrite: true
```

Publish the staged files as a build artifact:

```yaml
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: 'Publish Verify *.received.* files as Artifacts'
  name: 'verifypublish'
  condition: eq(variables['publishverify'], 'Yes')
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\Verify'
    ArtifactName: 'Verify'
    publishLocation: 'Container'
```
