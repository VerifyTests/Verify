# Getting Started Wizard

[Home](/docs/wiz/readme.md) > [Linux](Linux.md) > [Other](Linux_Other.md) > [Prefer CLI](Linux_Other_Cli.md) > NUnit > AzureDevOps

## Add NuGet packages

Add the following packages to the test project:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
dotnet add package NUnit
dotnet add package NUnit3TestAdapter
dotnet add package Verify.NUnit
```

## Implicit Usings

**All examples use [Implicit Usings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#implicitusings). Ensure the following is set to have examples compile correctly `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`** <!-- include: implicit-usings. path: /docs/mdsource/implicit-usings.include.md -->

If `ImplicitUsings` are not enabled, substitute usages of `Verify()` with `Verifier.Verify()`. <!-- endInclude -->


## Includes/Excludes

 * **All `*.received.*` files should be excluded from source control.** <!-- include: include-exclude. path: /docs/mdsource/include-exclude.include.md -->

eg. add the following to `.gitignore`

```
*.received.*
```

If using [UseSplitModeForUniqueDirectory](/docs/naming.md#usesplitmodeforuniquedirectory) also include:

`*.received/`


All `*.verified.*` files should be committed to source control. <!-- endInclude -->

## Line Endings

All text extensions of `*.verified.*` and have eol set to `lf`. <!-- include: line-endings. path: /docs/mdsource/line-endings.include.md -->

eg add the following to `.gitattributes`

```
*.verified.txt text eol=lf
*.verified.xml text eol=lf
*.verified.json text eol=lf
```
<!-- endInclude -->

## DiffPlex

The text comparison behavior of Verify is pluggable. The default behaviour, on failure, is to output both the received
and the verified contents as part of the exception. This can be noisy when verifying large strings.

[Verify.DiffPlex](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.DiffPlex) changes the text compare result to highlighting text differences inline.

This is optional, but recommended.

### Add the NuGet

```
dotnet add package Verify.DiffPlex
```

### Enable

```cs
[ModuleInitializer]
public static void Initialize() =>
    VerifyDiffPlex.Initialize();
```

## Verify.Terminal

[Verify.Terminal](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.Terminal) is a dotnet tool for managing snapshots from the command line.

This is optional.

### Install the tool

```
dotnet tool install -g verify.tool
```


## Sample Test

<!-- snippet: SampleTestNUnit -->
<a id='snippet-sampletestnunit'></a>
```cs
[TestFixture]
public class Sample
{
    [Test]
    public Task Test()
    {
        var person = ClassBeingTested.FindPerson();
        return Verify(person);
    }
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

## Diff Tool

Verify supports many [Diff Tools](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#supported-tools) for comparing received to verified.
While IDEs are supported, due to their MDI nature, using a different Diff Tool is recommended.

Tools supported by Linux:

 * [BeyondCompare](https://www.scootersoftware.com)
 * [P4Merge](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core-apps/merge-diff-tool-p4merge)
 * [DiffMerge](https://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/)
 * [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
 * [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Getting .received in output on AzureDevOps

Directly after the test runner step add a build step to set a flag if the testrunner failed. This is done by using a [failed condition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/conditions?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml). This flag will be evaluated in the CopyFiles and PublishBuildArtifacts steps below. <!-- include: build-server-azuredevops. path: /docs/mdsource/build-server-azuredevops.include.md -->

```yaml
- task: CmdLine@2
  displayName: 'Set flag to publish received files when previous step fails'
  condition: failed()
  inputs:
    script: 'echo ##vso[task.setvariable variable=publishverify]Yes'
```

Since the PublishBuildArtifacts step in DevOps does not allow a wildcard it is necessary to need stage the 'received' files before publishing:

```yaml
- task: CopyFiles@2
  condition: eq(variables['publishverify'], 'Yes')
  displayName: 'Copy received files to Artifact Staging'
  inputs:
    contents: '**\*.received.*' 
    targetFolder: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\Verify'
    cleanTargetFolder: true
    overWrite: true
```

Publish the staged files as a build artifact:

```yaml
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: 'Publish received files as Artifacts'
  name: 'verifypublish'
  condition: eq(variables['publishverify'], 'Yes')
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\Verify'
    ArtifactName: 'Verify'
    publishLocation: 'Container'
```
<!-- endInclude -->
