# Getting Started Wizard

[Home](/docs/wiz/readme.md) > [Windows](Windows.md) > [Visual Studio with ReSharper](Windows_VisualStudioWithReSharper.md) > [Prefer CLI](Windows_VisualStudioWithReSharper_Cli.md) > [Expecto](Windows_VisualStudioWithReSharper_Cli_Expecto.md) > AppVeyor

## Add NuGet packages

Add the following packages to the test project:

```
dotnet add package YoloDev.Expecto.TestSdk
dotnet add package Expecto
dotnet add package Verify.Expecto
```

## Implicit Usings

**All examples use [Implicit Usings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#implicitusings). Ensure `<ImplicitUsings>` is set to `enable` to ensure examples compile correctly.**<!-- include: implicit-usings. path: /docs/mdsource/implicit-usings.include.md -->

```
<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
```

If `ImplicitUsings` are not enabled, substitute usages of `Verify()` with `Verifier.Verify()`.<!-- endInclude -->


## Conventions


### Source Control Includes/Excludes

 * **All `*.received.*` files should be excluded from source control.**<!-- include: include-exclude. path: /docs/mdsource/include-exclude.include.md -->

eg. add the following to `.gitignore`

```
*.received.*
```

If using [UseSplitModeForUniqueDirectory](/docs/naming.md#usesplitmodeforuniquedirectory) also include:

`*.received/`


All `*.verified.*` files should be committed to source control.<!-- endInclude -->


### Text file settings

Text variants of verified and received have the following characteristics:<!-- include: text-file-settings. path: /docs/mdsource/text-file-settings.include.md -->

 * UTF8 with a [Byte order mark (BOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
 * Newlines as line-feed (lf)
 * No trailing newline

This manifests in several ways:


#### Source control settings

All text extensions of `*.verified.*` should have:

 * `eol` set to `lf`
 * `working-tree-encoding` set to `UTF-8`

eg add the following to `.gitattributes`

```
*.verified.txt text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.verified.xml text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.verified.json text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
```

#### EditorConfig settings

If modifying text verified/received files in an editor, it is desirable for the editor to respect the above conventions. For [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) enabled the following can be used:

```
# Verify settings
[*.{received,verified}.{json,txt,xml}]
charset = "utf-8-bom"
end_of_line = lf
indent_size = unset
indent_style = unset
insert_final_newline = false
tab_width = unset
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```


**Note that the above are suggested for subset of text extension. Add others as required based on the text file types being verified.**<!-- endInclude -->


### Conventions check

Conventions can be checked by calling `VerifyChecks.Run()` in a test

<!-- snippet: VerifyChecksExpecto -->
<a id='snippet-VerifyChecksExpecto'></a>
```cs
public class VerifyChecksTests
{
    [Tests]
    public static Test verifyChecksTest = Runner.TestCase(
        nameof(verifyChecksTest),
        () => VerifyChecks.Run(typeof(VerifyChecksTests).Assembly));
}
```

## DiffEngineTray

Install [DiffEngineTray](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/tray.md)

DiffEngineTray sits in the Windows tray. It monitors pending changes in snapshots, and provides a mechanism for accepting or rejecting those changes.

```
dotnet tool install -g DiffEngineTray
```

This is optional, but recommended. Also consider enabling [Run at startup](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/tray.md#run-at-startup).


## ReSharper


### Orphaned process detection

[Disable orphaned process detection](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#disable-orphaned-process-detection).


## Verify Plugin

Install the [ReSharper Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17241-verify-support)

Provides a mechanism for contextually accepting or rejecting snapshot changes inside the ReSharper test runner.

This is optional, but recommended.

## Disable orphaned process detection<!-- include: rider-resharper-orphaned-process. path: /docs/mdsource/rider-resharper-orphaned-process.include.md -->

Resharper and Rider have a feature [Check for orphaned processes spawned by test runner](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Reference__Options__Tools__Unit_Testing__Test_Runner.html).

> By default, a list of all processes that are launched by the executed tests. If some of theses processes do not exit after the test execution is over, ReSharper will suggest you to terminate the process. If your setup requires some processes started by the tests to continue running, you can clear this checkbox to avoid unnecessary notifications.

Since this project launches diff tools, it will trigger this feature and a dialog will show:

> All unit tests are finished, but child processes spawned by the test runner process are still running. Terminate child process?

<img src="/docs/resharper-spawned.png" alt="R# terminate process dialog" width="400">

As such this feature needs to be disabled:


### Disable for solution

Add the following to `[Solution].sln.DotSettings`.

```
<s:String x:Key="/Default/Housekeeping/UnitTestingMru/UnitTestRunner/SpawnedProcessesResponse/@EntryValue">DoNothing</s:String>
```


### Disable for machine

## DiffPlex

The text comparison behavior of Verify is pluggable. The default behaviour, on failure, is to output both the received
and the verified contents as part of the exception. This can be noisy when verifying large strings.

[Verify.DiffPlex](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.DiffPlex) changes the text compare result to highlighting text differences inline.

This is optional, but recommended.

### Add the NuGet

```
dotnet add package Verify.DiffPlex
```

### Enable

```cs
[ModuleInitializer]
public static void Initialize() =>
    VerifyDiffPlex.Initialize();
```

## Verify.Terminal

[Verify.Terminal](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify.Terminal) is a dotnet tool for managing snapshots from the command line.

This is optional.

### Install the tool

```
dotnet tool install -g verify.tool
```


## Sample Test

<!-- snippet: SampleTestExpecto -->
<a id='snippet-SampleTestExpecto'></a>
```fs
open Expecto
open VerifyTests
open VerifyExpecto

[<Tests>]
let tests =
    testTask "findPerson" {
        let person = ClassBeingTested.FindPerson()
        do! Verifier.Verify("findPerson", person)
    }
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

## Diff Tool

Verify supports many [Diff Tools](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#supported-tools) for comparing received to verified.
While IDEs are supported, due to their MDI nature, using a different Diff Tool is recommended.

Tools supported by Windows:

 * [BeyondCompare](https://www.scootersoftware.com)
 * [P4Merge](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core-apps/merge-diff-tool-p4merge)
 * [DeltaWalker](https://www.deltawalker.com/)

## Getting .received in output on AppVeyor

Use a [on_failure build step](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/#build-pipeline) to call [Push-AppveyorArtifact](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-worker-api/#push-artifact).<!-- include: build-server-appveyor. path: /docs/mdsource/build-server-appveyor.include.md -->

```
on_failure:
  - ps: Get-ChildItem *.received.* -recurse | % { Push-AppveyorArtifact $_.FullName -FileName $_.Name }
```
