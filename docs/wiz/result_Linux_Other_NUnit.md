# Getting Started Wizard

[Home](/docs/wiz/readme.md) > [Linux](pickide_Linux.md) > [Other](picktest_Linux_Other.md) > NUnit

## Add NuGet packages

Add the following packages to the test project:

<!-- snippet: NUnit-nugets -->
<a id='snippet-nunit-nugets'></a>
```csproj
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.4.1" />
<PackageReference Include="NUnit" Version="3.13.3" />
<PackageReference Include="NUnit3TestAdapter" Version="4.3.1" />
<PackageReference Include="Verify.NUnit" Version="19.6.0" />
```
<sup><a href='/src/NugetUsage/NUnitNugetUsage/NUnitNugetUsage.csproj#L7-L12' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-nunit-nugets' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

## Implicit Usings

**All examples use [Implicit Usings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#implicitusings). Ensure the following is set to have examples compile correctly `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`** <!-- include: implicit-usings. path: /docs/implicit-usings.include.md -->

If `ImplicitUsings` are not enabled, substitute usages of `Verify()` with `Verifier.Verify()`. <!-- endInclude -->
## Diff Tool

Verify supports many [Diff Tools](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#supported-tools) for comparing received to verified.
While IDEs are supported, due to their MDI nature, using a different Diff Tool is recommended.

Tool supported by Linux:
