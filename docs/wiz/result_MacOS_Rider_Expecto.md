### ImplicitUsings

**All examples use [ImplicitUsings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#implicitusings). Ensure the following is set to have examples compile correctly `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`** <!-- include: implicit-usings. path: /docs/implicit-usings.include.md -->

If `ImplicitUsings` are not enabled, substitute usages of `Verify()` with `Verifier.Verify()`. <!-- endInclude -->

## Rider Plugin

Install [Rider Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17240-verify-support)

Provides a mechanism for contextually accepting or rejecting snapshot changes inside the Rider test runner.

This is optional, but recommended.
