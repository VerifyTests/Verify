Verify is a snapshot tool that simplifies the assertion of complex data models and documents.

Verify is called on the test result during the assertion phase. It serializes that result and stores it in a file that matches the test name. On the next test execution, the result is again serialized and compared to the existing file. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new result.

Support is available via a [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/nuget-verify?utm_source=nuget-verify&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise).

## NuGet packages

 * https://nuget.org/packages/Verify.Xunit/
 * https://nuget.org/packages/Verify.NUnit/
 * https://nuget.org/packages/Verify.MSTest/


## Usage


### Class being tested

Given a class to be tested:

snippet: ClassBeingTested


### xUnit

Support for [xUnit](https://xunit.net/)

snippet: SampleTestXunit

 * [Verify Xunit Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGVogEltSkY)


### NUnit

Support for [NUnit](https://nunit.org/)

snippet: SampleTestNUnit


### MSTest

Support for [MSTest](https://github.com/Microsoft/testfx-docs)

snippet: SampleTestMSTest


### Initial Verification

When the test is initially run will fail with:

```
First verification. Sample.Test.verified.txt not found.
Verification command has been copied to the clipboard.
```

The clipboard will contain the following:

> cmd /c move /Y "C:\Code\Sample\Sample.Test.received.txt" "C:\Code\Sample\Sample.Test.verified.txt"

See also: [Clipboard](/docs/clipboard.md)

If a [Diff Tool](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine) is detected it will display the diff:

![InitialDiff](/docs/InitialDiff.png)

To verify the result:

 * Execute the command from the clipboard, or
 * Use the diff tool to accept the changes, or
 * Manually copy the text to the new file


#### Verified result

This will result in the `Sample.Test.verified.txt` being created:

snippet: Verify.Xunit.Tests/Snippets/Sample.Test.verified.txt


### Subsequent Verification

If the implementation of `ClassBeingTested` changes:

snippet: ClassBeingTestedChanged

And the test is re run it will fail with

```
Verification command has been copied to the clipboard.
Assert.Equal() Failure
                                  ↓ (pos 21)
Expected: ···\n  GivenNames: 'John',\n  FamilyName: 'Smith',\n  Spouse: 'Jill···
Actual:   ···\n  GivenNames: 'John James',\n  FamilyName: 'Smith',\n  Spouse:···
                                  ↑ (pos 21)
```

The clipboard will again contain the following:

> cmd /c move /Y "C:\Code\Sample\Sample.Test.received.txt" "C:\Code\Sample\Sample.Test.verified.txt"

See also: [Clipboard](/docs/clipboard.md)

#### The [Diff Tool](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine) is will display the diff:

![SecondDiff](/docs/SecondDiff.png)

The same approach can be used to verify the results and the change to `Sample.Test.verified.txt` is committed to source control along with the change to `ClassBeingTested`.


## Received and Verified

 * **All `*.verified.*` files should be committed to source control.**
 * **All `*.received.*` files should be excluded from source control.**
